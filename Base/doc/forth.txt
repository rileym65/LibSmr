Notes:
: and ; must be in a single parse action.  The parse function will place the
defined function into the custom functions array in the Forth object.  The
returned ForthProgram object is the reference to the custom function itself
and should not be deleted, this object is owned by the Forth object and will
be deleted when the Forth object is destructed.  Exec can be called on this
ForthObject should you desire to execute the custom function outside the
Forth environment.

: and ; for custom function defintion must not be included in any other code
passed into the parse function.
